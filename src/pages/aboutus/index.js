            <h1>About <span class="word-color">Us</span></h1>
            <p>I myself belong from a rural area. When I entered practical life 10 years back, I faced hardships through out
              my career. To attain my goal I travelled to Islamabad, Abbottabad and even Lahore in order to improve my
              skills
              and to become a useful citizen. It was then that a mission struck my mind that I will endeavour for a platform
              from where people from all over the world will visit and quench their thirst for knowledge from expert
              teachers
              and lecturers on spot and fully free of cost. The plus point is that here the medium of knowledge is Urdu so
              that our students can fully understand what they are being taught.</p>
